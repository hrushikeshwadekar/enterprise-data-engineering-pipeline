# Enterprise Data Engineering Pipeline 🚀

End-to-end **Data Engineering project** that demonstrates real-world ETL workflows, data quality checks, data warehousing (star schema), monitoring, and BI integration.

This project simulates how enterprise data pipelines are designed, built, validated, and consumed by analytics tools.
